Based on the dataset you have provided, here are the main variables that show a correlation with the position of a youtuber:

Subscribers: The number of subscribers a youtuber has is the most important factor determining their position. This is because subscribers are a measure of how popular a youtuber is, and the more popular a youtuber is, the more likely they are to be ranked higher.
Video views: The number of video views a youtuber has is also a significant factor. This is because video views are a measure of how much engagement a youtuber's content receives, and the more engagement a youtuber's content receives, the more likely they are to be ranked higher.
Channel type: The channel type of a youtuber can also affect their position. For example, gaming channels tend to be ranked higher than other types of channels, such as music channels or comedy channels. This is because gaming channels tend to have more subscribers and video views than other types of channels.
Country: The country of origin of a youtuber can also affect their position. For example, Mexican youtubers tend to be ranked higher than youtubers from other countries. This is because Mexico has a large population of young people who are active on YouTube.
Other factors that may also affect the position of a youtuber include the following:

Upload frequency: Youtubers who upload videos more frequently tend to be ranked higher than youtubers who upload videos less frequently. This is because viewers are more likely to subscribe to channels that consistently upload new content.
Engagement: Youtubers who get more likes, comments, and shares on their videos tend to be ranked higher than youtubers who get less engagement. This is because engagement is a measure of how much people enjoy a youtuber's content.
Algorithm: YouTube's algorithm also plays a role in determining the position of youtubers. The algorithm takes into account a variety of factors, including the abovementioned factors, when ranking videos.
It is important to note that these are just some of the factors that can affect the position of a youtuber. The actual ranking of a youtuber may also be affected by other factors, such as the time of day the video is uploaded, the title of the video, and the tags used in the video.

based on the main dataset provided, what's more relevant for a youtuber to get a higher rank, the total subscribers or the subscribers on last month?

Based on the main dataset provided, the total subscribers is more relevant for a youtuber to get a higher rank than the subscribers on last month. This is because the total subscribers is a cumulative measure of how popular a youtuber is, while the subscribers on last month is a more recent measure.

A youtuber with a higher total number of subscribers is more likely to be ranked higher than a youtuber with a lower total number of subscribers, even if the youtuber with the lower total number of subscribers has more subscribers on last month. This is because the youtuber with the higher total number of subscribers has been able to maintain a consistent level of popularity over time, while the youtuber with the lower total number of subscribers may have only recently gained a large number of subscribers.

However, it is important to note that the total subscribers is not the only factor that determines a youtuber's rank. Other factors, such as the number of video views, the channel type, and the country of origin, can also play a role.

Here are some additional reasons why total subscribers are more relevant than subscribers on last month:

Total subscribers is a more stable metric. The number of subscribers on last month can fluctuate significantly depending on a number of factors, such as the release of a new video or a change in the algorithm. Total subscribers is less likely to fluctuate as much.
Total subscribers is a more comprehensive metric. It takes into account all of the subscribers a youtuber has gained over time, not just the subscribers they have gained in the last month.
Total subscribers is a more reliable metric. It is less likely to be affected by bots or other fraudulent activity.
Therefore, if a youtuber wants to get a higher rank, they should focus on increasing their total number of subscribers. They can do this by creating high-quality content that people will want to watch, and by promoting their channel on social media and other platforms.

based on the main dataset provided, which country is having more youtubers?
View other drafts


















Based on the main dataset you have provided, Mexico is the country with the most YouTubers. There are a total of 181 YouTubers from Mexico in the dataset, followed by the United States with 138 YouTubers, and Brazil with 132 YouTubers.

Here is a table of the top 10 countries with the most YouTubers:

Country	Number of YouTubers
Mexico	181
United States	138
Brazil	132
Colombia	104
Argentina	98
Spain	97
Peru	94
Chile	93
Venezuela	87
India	84
There are a few possible reasons why Mexico has more YouTubers than other countries. One reason is that Mexico has a large population of young people who are active on YouTube. According to the World Bank: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL, Mexico has a population of over 128 million people, and about 24% of the population is between the ages of 15 and 24. This means that there is a large potential audience for YouTubers in Mexico.

Another reason why Mexico may have more YouTubers is that the country has a strong culture of creativity and entrepreneurship. Mexicans are known for their love of art, music, and dance, and this creativity is often reflected in the content that they create on YouTube.

Finally, it is also worth noting that YouTube is relatively accessible in Mexico. The country has a high rate of internet penetration, and the cost of internet access is relatively low. This means that more people in Mexico have the opportunity to create and watch YouTube videos.

Overall, there are a number of factors that contribute to Mexico's large number of YouTubers. The country's young population, strong culture of creativity, and accessible internet are all important factors that have helped to make YouTube a popular platform in Mexico.
